Simple 2d click game written in Java 

Created by: Blue and Kai

To build the file, all files in src need to be set as source file

Instructions on how to get the code to run:

1. Create new Java project in Eclipse .
2. Right click on the new project src file and import FileSystem and choose the source file provided.
3. Within Eclipse, run MainGame class for CLI, run StartGame class for GUI.
4. To run it outside of Eclipse, export as JAR and choose only the cli folder for the CLI app, select MainGame.java from cli folder as the main class.
5. For GUI, export as JAR and choose the img, gui folders as well as Character.java and WarriorsOfLight.java from cli folder, select StartGame.java from gui folder as the main class.

PS: Somehow, some of the fonts and images are unable to load properly on Linux. We used Eclipse with JavaSE-9 to code most, if not all of the program. 
However, it works perfectly fine on Mac OS X. For eg, the Super Villain icon shows up properly on Kai's MacBook but not on the lab computers...
